Subject Symbiote Advancing~
Text
Last night after gaining my symbiote, the first thing
I did was advance it levels. My first advances were put
towards maxing out damcap.
This morning I noticed as I was progressing through
advancing the other stats, that my damcap modifier is
now back down to 0.
I essentially lost all 21 points I had put into damcap.

I made a mithril faceplate with an airstone.
 
I got the 500 hp/mana/move, but I think the stats from
the airstone itself are in correct.
 
Before Faceplate: Damroll : 2435  Hitroll : 2549  Armor : -8292
After Faceplate: Damroll : 2435  Hitroll : 2549  Armor : -8322
When id'ing the faceplate I get:
Armor class is 30
Affects moves by 500.
Affects mana by 500
Affects hp by 500.
 
Also, Its got part of a room desc attached to it:
Object 'Mithril  [Exits: north east south west up down]
<           > Inside a crumpled down and old castle. There are some painted
<     O     > images all over the walls sh1 Faceplate ' is type armor
 
Just thought I'd give a heads up

I'm still at a loss attempting to create my own armors.
 
I've created water and airstones, and used the syntax of
armorcraft mithril waterstone mask, to create a mask.
 
Each time, it's created a mask, using up my slabs
of mithril, but never using up the stone.
 
I tried this with adamantite, as well as an airstone,
thinking that maybe the problem is unique to either the slab
or the runestones.
 
Am I doing something wrong? Has anyone else made equipment?
 
I've already lost two peices of Mithril, and am curious to
know how it stands with you guys.
