my mastery because the dragons mastery is nod made yet.
First about my dragon.
I mastered all stances, spell colors and weapons and i cannot gain
my mastery because the dragons mastery is nod made yet.
I hope that someone will complete it soon.
Second.
I've seen the message from login, abouth hiring builders.
I've build on alot of muds before i quit playing muds.
But now, i wish to play again a mud, and this could be a mud for me.
So, if my help is need i will gladly help.

We do a lot less damage than we should... Granted I don't
have gen 1 (which wouldn't change it THAT much) and the guy
had toughness AND my weaps aren't max level (as in weapon level)
But seriously. I do 3k rounds? And I just took 30k melee from a UK.
Would be a lot better if you could change it so we could wear eq
thanks.
 
 
P.S. Nothing is wrong with our mastery, it's just as it should be, but it
sucks something hard. If it could be... customized to this game>_> That'd
be nice.

Subject klion and casino botting~
Text
I caught and killed Klion botting in casino, took all his
gold and caped him with strife my alt. I just thought yould
like to know this because Klions a known botter. And I realize
this mud dont have many players yet, but, thats exactly why
you need to enforce this rule, otherwise when you do get players
Klion and his alts will be huge compared to other players from
cheating. Now if he wants to do things normaly I understand,
but, as it is he has already been caught by me and killed while
cheating.
